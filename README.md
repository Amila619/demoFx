# JavaFX Maven Project Structure (IntelliJ)

This project serves as a comprehensive example of how to structure a JavaFX application using Maven as the build tool within IntelliJ IDEA. It is designed to help developers, especially beginners, understand and implement best practices for building modern JavaFX applications. 

### Key Features

- **FXML Views with CSS Styling**: Create visually appealing user interfaces with the flexibility of FXML and CSS.
- **Controller Classes**: Manage application logic effectively by separating it from the UI layer.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Maintain a clean architecture by decoupling the UI, business logic, and backend components.
- **Beginner-Friendly Structure**: The project layout is intuitive and easy to navigate, making it ideal for those new to JavaFX or Maven.
- **Preconfigured Maven Setup**: Includes all necessary Maven dependencies and plugins for JavaFX, ensuring a smooth development experience.
- **Resource Management**: Demonstrates best practices for organizing and accessing resources like images, stylesheets, and FXML files.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
3. Ensure you have the required JDK and JavaFX SDK installed.
4. Build the project using Maven.
5. Run the application and explore the structure.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

This project leverages core OOP principles to ensure a robust and maintainable codebase:

- **Encapsulation**: Classes are designed to hide their internal state and expose only necessary functionalities through well-defined interfaces.
- **Inheritance**: Common behaviors and properties are abstracted into base classes to promote code reuse and reduce redundancy.
- **Polymorphism**: Interfaces and abstract classes are used to allow different implementations to be treated uniformly.
- **Abstraction**: Complex implementation details are hidden, exposing only the essential features to the user.

By adhering to these OOP principles, the project demonstrates how to build scalable and modular JavaFX applications.
